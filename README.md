The name blazer comes from Vannevar Bush's vision of a "new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record" (the basis for what I call eWorking).

eWorking relies on blazers just as personal computing relied on DOS to get established. DOS manages digital files; blazers create and manage digital objects; both are pretty mundane. So now I want to really open up the more inspiring interaction between blazers, libraries, monitors, namesets, products and word stores introduced by the examples here. I think I've done enough amateur coding to pass on the ideas to experts to work their magic.

Release 1.1-alpha -"Criteria fed computers" - is available for download - https://github.com/chrisglasier/eWorking/releases

The main idea behind this release is to elaborate on the idea of providing criteria for computers to work on rather than giving specific commands.
