This animation shows cloning and accurate placement of beds on ten floors. More importantly it shows mass production of useful information attractors - they can accept any kind of data about themselves as key/value pairs: {size: 1500x2000x500, cost:7500, delivery: 03-02-16, status: made, booked : ...}. Blazers take out the awkwardness from 3D charateristics of such information and make sure curly brackets and such automatically convert plain text into digital objects machines understand easily handle. 

The hotel exercise is an example of eWorking that most people can relate to, not perhaps as a construction project as a whole but almost certainly related to some aspect of collaborative efforts - communications, digital models, search, purchases, progress, budget, logistics, quality and so on. eWorking opens up new approaches to familiar processes. Wiki's THREE JS modelling procedure describes the approach I took here. I hope it is useful to discuss the introduction of a new way of working in general.
