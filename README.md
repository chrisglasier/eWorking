The name blazer comes from Vannevar Bush's vision of a "new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record" (the basis for what I call eWorking).

eWorking relies on blazers just as personal computing relied on DOS to get established. DOS manages digital files; blazers create and manage digital objects; both are pretty mundane. So now I want to really open up the more inspiring interaction between blazers, libraries, monitors, namesets, products and word stores introduced by the examples here. I think I've done enough amateur coding to pass on the ideas to experts to work their magic.

Release plan

Completed

1 Starter - This release is for review and development of blazer code and code and methods for example monitors, namesets, products and word stores.

2 Criteria fed computers - The main idea behind this release is to elaborate on the idea of providing criteria for computers to work on rather than giving specific commands.

Planned

3 - Mass cloning - cloning and positioning 14 x 2 x 10 beds in bedrooms to form building bounding box.

4 - 3d Modeller window - onresize, zoom, pan, etc. including Blazer pad (issue #3).

5 - Animation - distributing beds - simulated hoist.
